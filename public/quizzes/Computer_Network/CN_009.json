    "answer": "A) A set of rules applied on a router interface to permit or deny packets",
    "explanation": "An ACL is a set of rules applied on a router interface that decides which packets are allowed (permit) and which packets are blocked (deny) based on specified criteria.",

    "answer": "C) The packet is denied",
    "explanation": "ACLs have an implicit deny at the end. If a packet doesn't match any rule, it is automatically dropped. This is why you often need to add a 'permit any' rule at the end.",
