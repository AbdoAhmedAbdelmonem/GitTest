    "answer": "A) Layer 1 - Physical Layer",
    "explanation": "A hub operates at Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of the OSI model. It is a simple device that receives electrical signals on one port and broadcasts them to all other ports without any intelligence. Hubs do not examine MAC addresses or make any forwarding decisions - they simply regenerate and repeat signals to all connected devices.",

    ],
    "answer": "B) It creates a single collision domain for all connected devices",
    "explanation": "A hub creates a single collision domain, meaning all connected devices share the same bandwidth and only one device can transmit at a time. When multiple devices try to transmit simultaneously, collisions occur, reducing network efficiency. This makes hubs unsuitable for modern networks with high traffic. Switches solve this problem by creating separate collision domains for each port.",

    "explanation": "A switch operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

    "answer": "B) By examining the source MAC address of incoming frames",
    "explanation": "A switch learns MAC addresses dynamically through a process called 'learning'. When a frame enters a port, the switch examines the source MAC address and associates it with that port in its MAC address table (CAM table).

    "explanation": "A broadcast domain is a logical network segment in which any device can directly reach any other device by broadcasting at the data link layer.
