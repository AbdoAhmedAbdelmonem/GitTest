This improves network performance by reducing broadcast traffic, enhances security by isolating network segments, allows better IP address management, and enables more efficient use of IP address space. Subnetting is accomplished by borrowing bits from the host portion to create additional network segments.",

    "explanation": "In a standard Ethernet straight-through cable, a PC (DTE device) transmits data on pins 1 and 2 (TX+/TX-) and receives data on pins 3 and 6 (RX+/RX-). The switch or hub does the opposite: it receives on pins 1 and 2 and transmits on pins 3 and 6. This pin arrangement allows proper bidirectional communication between the PC and switch. Pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are used for Gigabit Ethernet or Power over Ethernet in modern implementations.",

    "explanation": "CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) is the media access control method used in traditional Ethernet networks. Devices listen (carrier sense) before transmitting to avoid collisions. If a collision is detected, devices stop transmitting, wait a random time, and retry. Modern switched full-duplex networks don't need CSMA/CD since each port is a separate collision domain.",

    "answer": "B) Connection-oriented and reliable",
    "explanation": "TCP provides connection-oriented and reliable communication. Connection-oriented means TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data (using a three-way handshake) and maintains it throughout the session. Reliable means TCP guarantees data delivery through acknowledgments, retransmissions of lost packets, sequencing to maintain order, and error checking using checksums. This makes TCP suitable for applications requiring guaranteed delivery like web browsing, email, and file transfers.",

    "explanation": "A Layer 3 switch (also called a multilayer switch) can perform both switching and routing functions. It operates at both Layer 2 (switching frames based on MAC addresses) and Layer 3 (routing packets based on IP addresses).
