    "answer": "B) Network Address Translation",
    "explanation": "NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It is a method used by routers to translate private (unregistered) IP addresses used within a local network to public (registered) IP addresses for communication over the internet. NAT was developed primarily to solve the problem of IPv4 address depletion and to provide an additional layer of security.",

    ],
    "answer": "B) To solve the problem of IP address depletion",
    "explanation": "The primary purpose of NAT is to solve the problem of IPv4 address depletion. By allowing multiple devices on a private network to share one or more public IP addresses, NAT conserves the limited number of available public IPv4 addresses. This enables organizations to use private IP addresses internally while still accessing the internet through a smaller number of public addresses.",

    "explanation": "Static NAT provides a one-to-one mapping between a private (inside local) IP address and a public (inside global) IP address.

    "answer": "B) New requests from new hosts will be discarded",
    "explanation": "In Dynamic NAT, if all inside global IP addresses in the pool are currently in use (exhausted), any new connection request from a new host will be discarded or denied. The host must wait until an IP address becomes available in the pool, which happens when an existing translation times out or is released.

    "explanation": "In Dynamic NAT, the timeout value is a configurable period after which the router removes an inside global address mapping from the NAT table if it is not actively being used. This allows the public IP address to be returned to the pool and made available for other hosts. The timeout mechanism ensures efficient use of the limited pool of public IP addresses.",
