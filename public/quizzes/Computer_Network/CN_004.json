    "explanation": "Ethernet is primarily designed for and most widely used in Local Area Networks (LANs). It was developed to connect computers and devices within a limited geographical area such as homes, offices, or buildings. While Ethernet technology has evolved and can be used in other contexts, its primary application remains in LANs where it provides high-speed, reliable communication between devices on the same local network.",

    "answer": "A) Layer 1 and Layer 2",
    "explanation": "Ethernet operates at both Layer 1 (Physical Layer) and Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model. At the Physical Layer, it handles the actual transmission of signals over the physical medium (cables, connectors, voltage levels). At the Data Link Layer, it manages addressing (MAC addresses), framing, and preparing packets for transmission. This dual-layer operation makes Ethernet a complete link-layer technology.",

    "answer": "C) Actual signal transmission",
    "explanation": "Actual signal transmission is the responsibility of the Physical Layer (Layer 1), not the Data Link Layer (Layer 2). The Data Link Layer handles logical functions such as MAC addressing, framing packets into proper Ethernet frames, and preparing packets for transmission. The Physical Layer then takes these prepared frames and handles the actual electrical, optical, or radio signal transmission over the physical medium.",

    "explanation": "MAC (Media Access Control) Address is the addressing scheme used by Ethernet at the Data Link Layer. MAC addresses are hardware addresses that uniquely identify network interface cards. IP addresses operate at Layer 3 (Network Layer), port addresses are used at Layer 4 (Transport Layer), and sequence numbers are used for flow control.

    "explanation": "The broadcast MAC address is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF (all bits set to 1). When a frame is sent to this destination address, it is delivered to all devices on the local network segment. This is different from 255.255.255.255, which is an IP broadcast address. The all-zeros address (0000.0000.0000) is invalid, and 0100.5E00.0000 is related to multicast addressing.

    ],
    "answer": "C) To avoid internal electromagnetic interference",
    "explanation": "The wires in an Ethernet cable are twisted to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk between wire pairs. When electrical current flows through a wire, it generates an electromagnetic field. By twisting the wires in pairs, the electromagnetic fields from each wire in the pair tend to cancel each other out, reducing interference both within the cable (crosstalk) and from external sources. This twisting is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and data transmission quality.",
