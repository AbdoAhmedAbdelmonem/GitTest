# Folder Management Enhancement - Admin Delete & Rename Functionality

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Admin Folder Controls

### 🎯 **What Was Added**

**New `FolderActions` Component** (`components/admin-controls.tsx`):
- **Rename Folder**: Admins can rename any folder with real-time validation
- **Delete Folder**: Admins can delete folders with confirmation dialog
- **Security**: Same authentication checks as file operations
- **UI Consistency**: Matches existing FileActions design with folder-specific styling

### 🔧 **Key Features**

**1. Folder Rename Functionality**:
- **Blue-themed UI** (vs amber for files) to distinguish folder operations
- **Real-time validation** ensures folder names are not empty
- **Success animations** provide visual feedback
- **API Integration** uses same `/api/google-drive/rename/[folderId]` endpoint

**2. Folder Delete Functionality**:
- **Enhanced warning dialog** specifically mentions deleting subfolders and files
- **Strong visual warnings** in red with alert icons
- **Confirmation required** to prevent accidental deletions
- **API Integration** uses same `/api/google-drive/delete/[folderId]` endpoint

**3. Visual Differentiation**:
- **Folder Actions**: Blue/cyan color scheme
- **File Actions**: Amber/orange color scheme
- **Clear distinction** between folder and file management

### 📍 **Where It's Available**

**Drive Root Page** (`app/drive/[driveId]/page.tsx`):
- Admin users see folder actions on all folders in root directory
- Actions appear below folder cards when admin is logged in

**Subfolder Pages** (`app/drive/[driveId]/[...folderPath]/page.tsx`):
- Admin users see folder actions on all subfolders
- Consistent functionality across all navigation levels

### 🎨 **UI/UX Details**

**Folder Actions Buttons**:
```
[📝] [🗑️]  (Blue rename + Red delete buttons)
```

**Folder Rename Dialog**:
- **Title**: "Rename Folder" (blue gradient)
- **Input**: Pre-filled with current folder name
- **Validation**: Real-time empty name checking
- **Animation**: Loading and success states

**Folder Delete Dialog**:
- **Warning**: Clear messaging about deleting contents
- **Icon**: Alert triangle for danger indication
- **Text**: "This will also delete all files and subfolders inside this folder"
- **Confirmation**: Requires explicit delete action

### 🔒 **Security & Permissions**

- **Admin Only**: Only users with `isAdmin` flag can see folder actions
- **Session Validation**: Uses `getStudentSession()` for authentication
- **API Security**: Same security layer as file operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for failed operations

### 🔄 **Integration Points**

**API Endpoints Used**:
- `POST /api/google-drive/rename/[folderId]` - Folder renaming
- `DELETE /api/google-drive/delete/[folderId]` - Folder deletion

**Event Handling**:
- `onRenamed()` - Triggers page refresh after rename
- `onDeleted()` - Triggers page refresh after delete
- **Auto-refresh**: Page automatically updates to show changes

### 📱 **Responsive Design**

- **Mobile Friendly**: Buttons scale appropriately
- **Touch Targets**: Adequate size for mobile interaction
- **Dialog Sizing**: Responsive modal sizing
- **Text Truncation**: Long folder names handled gracefully

### 🎉 **User Experience**

1. Admin clicks blue edit button on folder
2. Dialog opens with current name pre-filled
3. Admin types new name
4. Real-time validation ensures name is valid
5. Success animation plays
6. Page refreshes to show renamed folder

**Folder Delete Flow**:

6. Page refreshes to show updated folder list

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**

The folder management system is now complete with:
- ✅ **Create folders** (existing CreateActions component)
- ✅ **Rename folders** (new FolderActions component)  
- ✅ **Delete folders** (new FolderActions component)
- ✅ **Navigate folders** (existing drive navigation)

Admin users now have full CRUD operations for both files and folders! 🎯
